# Wormhole

> Plug and play file uploader for Laravel applications.

Wormhole is a package for Laravel applications that provides a couple of methods which can be used to upload file and store them to different location in server. Make no mistake, Laravel itself provides very convenient way to upload file, and this package is using nothing but Laravel's `Storage` class under the hood. The difference is, methods provided here can be used for multiple purposes. I find myself copying and pasting same code on all of my projects and so I thought to put these methods in a package. Nothing fancy! 

**Plus**, there is a Vue component included with progress bar to show file uploading progress and with configurable front-end validation, which can be published if anyone wants.
